> The intraQuarter data zip file is ~255MB, which is too large to store in a github repo (max of 50MB?), so you need to
download the [intraQuarter.zip](http://pythonprogramming.net/downloads/intraQuarter.zip "intraQuarter.zip") file separately.

***

> Once you have performed a ```git clone``` or a download zip/unzip, you can install all of the python packages by doing:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
... or:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
